            <h1>My Terminal Side-Project</h1>
            <p>Recently after skimming through the <a href="https://github.com/midas-os/MidAS-rs">MidAS-rs</a> GitHub repository I saw my command line code.<br>
            Afterwards I got the idea of making another command line, but this time as a windows application.<br>
            Obviously this isn't the most original project, but I thought it'd be a fun way to cure my boredom!<br>
            I made a version that I almost got working in C++, but after some troubles with reading input I moved it to C#.<br>
            If you're interested in the project and its progress, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/MindlessSea/Terminal">GitHub repository</a>!<br>
            Thanks for reading!</p>

            Keep in mind, at this point the game has only been in development for about a week.</p>
